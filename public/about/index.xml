      <description>My education is in mathematics and statistics and I received my PhD from the ETH Zurich (Switzerland) in 2009. Prior to that, I was a MEXT fellow at Okayama University in Japan. I have experience working on multidisciplinary projects to answer research and policy-making questions in the fields of climate change and environmental sciences besides criminology. My expertise is on developing and applying statistical methodology and computational methods as well as providing training to statisticians and non-statisticians.</description>
