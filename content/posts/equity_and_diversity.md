Diversity and inclusion are at the core of most of the successful teams. However, we still have a long way to go for that to be a norm instead of an exception. <!--more-->

Below are some of the findings about female representation in research, higher education and the media which highlight the need to work towards more diverse and inclusive groups:


<i class="fa fa-angle-right"></i>  According to the [UNESCO Institute for Statistics](http://uis.unesco.org/en/topic/women-science), "Women account for a minority of the world’s researchers" 



<i class="fa fa-angle-right"></i> Another Unesco report about Women in Science has found that ["Less than 30% of the world’s researchers are women"] (http://uis.unesco.org/sites/default/files/documents/fs51-women-in-science-2018-en.pdf)


 <i class="fa fa-angle-right"></i> ["Women are missing from the ranks of higher education and research"] (http://uis.unesco.org/en/news/women-are-missing-ranks-higher-education-and-research)


<i class="fa fa-angle-right"></i> According to the World Bank, "Gender equality is a critical component of economic growth". However, when looking at the Women, Business and the Law index,
Only six countries have equal rights for men and women according to the "Women, Business and the Law 2019" [report.](https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/31327/WBL2019.pdf)


<i class="fa fa-angle-right"></i> A new global study on [Global Media Monitoring](http://cdn.agilitycms.com/who-makes-the-news/Imported/reports_2015/global/gmmp_global_report_en.pdf) has found that only 19% of the science and technology experts highlighted in the media are women. 

Raising awareness <i class="fa fa-bullhorn"></i>, identifying and supporting those who are under-represented are the first steps towards a change!
